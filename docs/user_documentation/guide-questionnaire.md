**
MOLGENIS offers a questionnaire module which can present a questionnaire to users.
These questionnaires are defined in our [EMX format](./ref-emx.md). Each questionnaire can be filled in once, and generates one row
of data in a table used to collect the questionnaires that where submitted.

It asks for a date of birth and if the resulting age is greater then 18, the question "Do you have a drivers license" will appear.
